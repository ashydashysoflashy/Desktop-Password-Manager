Final Project:
Welcome to PassVault, a JavaFX desktop application password-manager.
All account info is stored in plaintext in a locally stored csv.
PassVault keeps track of the passwords it stores in a csv file, and also has the ability to generate random passwords.

This was a first year project, so passwords are only stored in plaintext.
